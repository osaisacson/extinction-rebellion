          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>
            Since nobody has time for long and tedious discussions, the
            collaborative demand system instead works like this (a merry mix of
            reddit, github and wikipedia):
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            - Anyone can suggest a demand, these end up in the bottom
            'suggested' section
          </p>
          <p>
            - If 1000 people agree with your demand, it moves to the 'Discussed'
            section
          </p>
          <p>
            - Once in 'Discussed' the options for adding suggested improvements
            to your demand are open
          </p>
          <p>
            - If 20 people agree with a suggested change then that change is
            accepted to the demand description
          </p>
          <p>
            - Once the demand definition is completed and has 10,000 upvotes it
            gets sent as a petition to the representative who can make the next
            move, and the demand moves to the 'active' section.
          </p>
          <p>
            - In 'Active' we can see where the demand is at, and what you can do
            to push it forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            - If a demand gets stuck, you'll find here how and where you can
            rebel.
          </p>

        <Discussed />

        <Suggested />
